## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game project! This is a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a modern design, responsive layout, and a space-themed dark mode for an immersive experience.

- **Dynamic Turn Indicator**: Clearly shows which player's turn it is, enhancing the gameplay experience.
- **Animations**: Smooth animations for cell clicks make the game visually appealing.
- **Modal Notifications**: A popup modal announces the winner or if the game is a draw, adding to the excitement.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between a light and a space-themed dark mode to suit your preference.
